#We created a JSON-Server to manage our database.
#First you have to know about Eager over fetching: At App Startup, the over-fetching occurs when a client retrieves more data than it actually needs.   
What if the client has a bandwidth constrained connection: We should implement lazy fetching(Make a single request that asks for a minimum amount of data)
Bonus : Over loading is a database optimization strategy where related data is loaded in advance ( in a single query) along the main data to minimize the number of database queries.
We are going to first look on how to manage data fetching with plain redux ( Async Thunks Functions), then Redux Toolkit Query(This is an add-on).

#1st Tip: Never make a request inside a reducer, because they should be 100% synchronous and only operate on their arguments - no outside variables! 
##Change in state when request starts, finishes, or fails. ->>>
#Adding state for data loading at main website screen: While we're fetching the data, Data fetched, and error while loading
#User loads loads app: we set isLoading to true, data set to empty array and error to null
#Response!: isLoading set to false, data is found! and error set to null
#Error occured in the request
isLoading set to false, data is empty array and error got message to 'Failed'

## The above will be implemented using async thunk function:
The Async Thunk Function automatically dispatches actions of type(pending) or (fulfilled) or(rejected)during data-loading.
See it's implementation.

## Fined-grained loading state: 
So when deleting an element from a list, we would like to have a snipper loading whilst deleting the element, but we do not know on which element the spinner should show up. Here comes local fine-grained local state, where we store our state for that inside of react component, not inside redux store anymore.

## Hooks used:useState,useEffect,useCallBack to memoize functions between renders.
useCallBack hook takes 2 arguments, callback function and array of dependencies, if any of the dependencies change, the memoized function is recreated, otherwise the cached version returned

## Don't forget there are 2 ways for data fetching in Redux Toolkit:Async Thunk Funtions or Redux Toolkit Query.
Meanwhile Redux Toolkit Query takes care of making requests, handling errors, handling loading state, caching data,refetching data-> makes handling loading data much easier
