#First you have to know about Eager over fetching: At App Startup, the over-fetching occurs when a client retrieves more data than it actually needs.   
What if the client has a bandwidth constrained connection: We should implement lazy fetching(Make a single request that asks for a minimum amount of data)
Bonus : Over loading is a database optimization strategy where related data is loaded in advance ( in a single query) along the main data to minimize the number of database queries.
We are going to first look on how to manage data fetching with plain redux ( Async Thunks Functions), then Redux Toolkit Query(This is an add-on).

#1st Tip: Never make a request inside a reducer, because they should be 100% synchronous and only operate on their arguments - no outside variables! 

#Adding state for data loading at main website screen: While we're fetching the data, Data fetched, and error while loading

User loads loads app: we set isLoading to true, data set to empty array and error to null
Response!: isLoading set to false, data is found! and error set to null
