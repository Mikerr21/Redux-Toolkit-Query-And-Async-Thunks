#First you have to know about Eager over fetching: At App Startup, the over-fetching occurs when a client retrieves more data than it actually needs.   
What if the client has a bandwidth constrained connection: We should implement lazy fetching(Make a single request that asks for a minimum amount of data)
Bonus : Over loading is a database optimization strategy where related data is loaded in advance ( in a single query) along the main data to minimize the number of database queries.
We are going to first look on how to manage data fetching with plain redux ( Async Thunks Functions), then Redux Toolkit Query(This is an add-on).
